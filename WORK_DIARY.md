### Day 1: cloud-init Fundamentals
**Date**: [To be filled]
**Duration**: [To be tracked]
**Status**: 🔄 In Progress

#### Session Goals
##### 🧠 What is cloud-init?
**Simple Definition**: cloud-init is like a "setup script" that runs when a computer boots for the first time, automatically configuring the system exactly how you want it.

**Real-world Analogy**: 
Imagine you're setting up a new phone. Instead of manually:
- Creating user accounts
- Installing apps
- Configuring WiFi
- Setting up security
- Customizing settings

cloud-init is like having a "setup wizard" that does ALL of this automatically based on a configuration file you prepared in advance.

**Technical Definition**: 
cloud-init is the industry standard multi-distribution method for cross-platform cloud instance initialization. It's supported by all major public cloud providers, provisioning systems for private cloud infrastructure, and bare-metal installations.

##### 🏗️ How does cloud-init fit in our architecture?

```

└───────────────────┘
```

##### 🎯 Why does cloud-init exist?
1. **Repeatability**: Configure 1 server or 1000 servers identically
2. **Speed**: Automation is faster than manual setup
3. **Reliability**: No human errors, consistent results
4. **Documentation**: Configuration is code, automatically documented
5. **Security**: Can apply security settings from day zero

##### 📝 cloud-init Lifecycle (What happens when?)

```
