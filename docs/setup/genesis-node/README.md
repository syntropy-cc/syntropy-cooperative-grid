# Genesis Node Setup Guide

The Genesis Node is the foundational node that bootstraps the Syntropy Cooperative Grid. This guide will walk you through setting up the first node in your cooperative grid.

## Prerequisites

### Hardware Requirements
- **CPU**: 8+ cores (16+ recommended)
- **RAM**: 16+ GB (32+ GB recommended)
- **Storage**: 100+ GB SSD (500+ GB recommended)
- **Network**: Stable internet connection (100+ Mbps recommended)
- **Power**: Uninterrupted power supply recommended

### Software Requirements
- **OS**: Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS (fresh installation)
- **Access**: SSH access configured
- **Network**: Static IP address recommended

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/syntropy-cc/syntropy-cooperative-grid.git
cd syntropy-cooperative-grid

# 2. Run the bootstrap script
./bootstrap.sh

# 3. Initialize the Genesis Node
./scripts/bootstrap/genesis-setup.sh
```

## Detailed Setup Process

### Step 1: Infrastructure Preparation
- Hardware assembly and OS installation
- Network configuration and SSH setup
- Security hardening and initial configuration

### Step 2: Genesis Node Deployment
- Terraform infrastructure provisioning
- Ansible configuration management
- Kubernetes cluster initialization

### Step 3: Core Services
- Monitoring stack deployment
- Container registry setup
- Network mesh configuration

### Step 4: Verification
- Health checks and validation
- Performance benchmarking
- Security audit

## Post-Setup

After successful setup, your Genesis Node will:
- Serve as the initial Kubernetes master
- Provide container registry services
- Host monitoring and alerting
- Enable other nodes to join the grid

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions will be documented here as the community grows.
